<h1>Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization</h1>
<p>DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION BY <h1>SEABORN</h1></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to visualize the survival rate by different features 
  such as embarkation town and sex using Seaborn for effective data visualization. 
  The project includes various types of plots, including barplots, survival rate comparisons by town, 
  and customized legends. 
  The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for analyzing historical passenger 
  information from the RMS Titanic, including whether passengers survived or not.
</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
  The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset available from the Seaborn library, 
  which contains data on passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes features like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Survived</strong>: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).</li>
  <li><strong>Embark Town</strong>: The town where the passenger boarded.</li>
  <li><strong>Sex</strong>: The gender of the passenger.</li>
  <li>Other attributes: Age, class, fare, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to perform data visualization tasks to better understand 
  patterns in passenger survival based on different features such as gender, embarkation town, and more.
</p>

<h2>Key Visualizations</h2>
<h3>1. Survival Rate by Embarkation Town</h3>
<p>
  A bar plot shows the survival rates of passengers categorized by the town where they boarded. 
  The data is further divided by gender for deeper insights.
</p>

<h3>2. Legend Customization</h3>
<p>
  The legend is placed outside the plot using the bbox_to_anchor argument, ensuring that the plot 
  and legend do not overlap. The legend also includes custom labels such as 'Female' and 'Male' to improve clarity.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This project demonstrates how Seaborn can be used to visualize categorical and continuous variables 
  from the Titanic dataset. Customizations, such as moving the legend outside the plot, 
  improve the overall readability and presentation of the visualizations.
